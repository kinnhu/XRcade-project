In case you didn't know I love grappling hooks in VR. My Idea is to have a small arcade main world with 3 (probably) arcade machines with different grapple hook race courses with different themes.
I also plan to show best times for each game next to each machine. 


1) main hub: making the main hub look nice and possibly a leaderboard
  estimated challenge 4/5 or 2/5 depends on if I decide to save the times to a file inbetween.
2) the grapple hook: changing the grapple hook code that I already have to make it better
  estimated challenge 3/5: I would like to change which system the velocity is added to, how the grapple is activated (make it only need the trigger to be used), and where the grapplepoint appears 
  I would also like to add a rechargeable double jump but I believe that would be rather simple to add. Otherwise it is all done already.
3) the maps: making good short maps to race through
  estimated challenge 2/5: there is little difficulty tbh it would just take a very long amount of time. (btw I so far have the idea of space wizard game and jurrasic period dinosaur type place, last one may be a street race)

The main inspiration for this is when I just got VR and was messing around with friends in VRchat there was this one grapple hook game we found on it and we all ran our
batteries dead about 2 times each grinding for the best possible time on it. Also another inspiration is blues clues a little bit with the sort of jumping into paintings sort of thing but in this game it would be different video games that
you race around. My plan for those is to make them look like different video games that you teleport inside rather than a different level
