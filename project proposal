In case you didn't know I love grappling hooks in VR. My Idea is to have a small arcade main world with 3 (probably) arcade machines with different grapple hook race courses with different themes.
I also plan to show best times for each game next to each machine. The main inspiration for this is when I just got VR and was messing around with friends in VRchat there was this one grapple hook game we found on it and we all ran our
batteries dead about 2 times each grinding for the best possible time on it


1) main hub: making the main hub look nice and possibly a leaderboard
  estimated challenge 4/5 or 2/5 depends on if I decide to save the times to a file inbetween.
2) the grapple hook: changing the grapple hook code that I already have to make it better
  estimated challenge 3/5: I would like to change which system the velocity is added to, how the grapple is activated (make it only need the trigger to be used), and where the grapplepoint appears 
  I would also like to add a rechargeable double jump but I believe that would be rather simple to add. Otherwise it is all done already.
3) the maps: making good short maps to race through
  estimated challenge 2/5: there is little difficulty tbh it would just take a very long amount of time.
